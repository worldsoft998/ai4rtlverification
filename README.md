*** Artificial Intelligence for Stimulus Generation Optimization in Hardware Functional Verification ***


###############
Researches 
###############

My research is about the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to hardware functional verification. Main algorithms will be targeted at Artificial Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning and Regression. Other AI/ML technologies will also be tested. A though benchmarking is unlikely because the performance of verification is not only affacted by the chosen AI models but also by a great number of other factors such as the simulators, the exact algorithms and Python libraries chosen, the RTL specs etc.

Development
###############

In addition to paper writing, I am also planning to develop some tools, codes, apps for use together with verification tools and environments, either as standalone, plugins or modules for EDA tools. As a beginning I will make some AI tools for 
***Stimulus Generation Optimization in Hardware Functional Verification***, 
and then more tools will be developed using AI techniques.

I will firstly focus on UVM/SystemVerilog for RTL verification, and simulation will be tested using main stream simulators with .do file as simulation automation scripts. Python will be chosen as the only AI language because of its abundance of AI/ML related libraries and packages.

However, they can be extended to other verification methodologies and HDL/HVL languages as well as other simulators and automation systems.
